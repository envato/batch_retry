# Batch Retry

This library provides an interface to submit a batch of records to submit to an API, which retries all failed records with an exponential backoff. Currently it just supports Kinesis using the [PutRecords](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecords.html) API method, but it can be used to support more APIs.

Usage:

```
from batch_retry import BatchRetry
from batch_retry import KinesisProcessor

def main():
  kinesis_client = boto3.client('kinesis')
  send_function = KinesisProcessor(kinesis_client, 'my-stream', batch_size=250).send
  BatchRetry(send_function, retries=5).send_with_retries(['my_first_record'])
```
